## Python Bank App

Create a bank app which satifies the following acceptance criteria:
```
Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When she prints her bank statement
Then she would see
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

###Â Requirements
You should be able to interact with your code via python console.
Deposits, withdrawal can be taken in as inputs to the python script
Account statement (date, amount, balance) printed on the console.
Your code should follow SOLID principles 

### Version 1
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Version 2
- Add unit tests to validate your code
- Push the data to a database (like dynamoDB on AWS)

### Version 3
- Think of Infrastrcuture as code for your resources
- Run this as a Serverless app with an api to access this 

### Example for a interactive python code is in the repo

Assuming your code looks like this:

```
class Bank:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        [...]
```

We would want to interact with it like this:

```
